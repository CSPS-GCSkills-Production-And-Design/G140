		<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-5"><p>Performance management is an ongoing process that involves planning, developing, coaching, providing feedback and evaluating employee performance, including recognizing work well done. It’s not an annual event or something that can be accomplished in a few one-on-one meetings. It’s a combination of day-to-day activities and time-specific events. That includes, at a minimum, a mid‑year performance review for all employees, and an annual year‑end assessment. Employees on probation must be assessed within their probationary period. Any definition of performance management can have several important elements. One of the most important things to remember is that performance management is about ensuring that organizational results can be met successfully. At the individual and team levels, it’s about managing and engaging people. It’s also about building trust. Flowcharts aren’t going to solve performance issues. Relationships and communication are key to the performance management process.</p>
