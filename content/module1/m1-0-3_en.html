Performance management is an ongoing process throughout the year. The performance agreement, which spells out the work expectations for each employee, is the focal point of performance management. The process must meet the requirements of the <a title="Directive on Official Languages for People Management" href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26168" target="_blank" rel="external" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26168" class="external">Directive on Official Languages for People Management</a>.</p>
                    <p>Performance management is not a one‑time event.</p>
                    <p>The Performance Management Annual Cycle is comprised of three time-specific requirements, as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>At the beginning of the fiscal year, when performance expectations are established;</li>
                        <li>At mid‑year, when performance is reviewed; and</li>
                        <li>At year‑end (or at the end of probation), when performance is assessed.</li>
                    </ul>

                                    <li>“Continuous feedback and coaching, employee recognition, performance development through the employee’s learning and development plan, and development of performance improvement plan if required.”</li>

                                <p>Performance management is not a one‑time event. As managers and supervisors, we need to step back and see the broader context. Regular feedback and support is provided to employees as part of an ongoing dialogue about work performance between managers or supervisors and their direct reports.</p>
                                <p>In this course, we will discuss what tools, techniques and best practices you need to apply to be an effective manager or supervisor. It will provide you with a concrete perspective on how and what to do in order to manage the performance of your employees successfully.</p>
                                <p>Now that you’ve had time to see an overview of the Performance Management Annual Cycle, let’s review some of its phases in more detail.</p>
