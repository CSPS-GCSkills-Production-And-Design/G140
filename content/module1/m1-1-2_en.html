They cascade down into branches, directorates and teams. In this way, they reach the performance agreements of all public servants which allow each one of us to contribute to the success of our organizations.</p>

<p>There are questions at different levels of the organization that any manager and supervisor should consider in order to develop effective cascading business priorities or enterprise-wide commitments and goals for those of you in the executive cadre.</p>

<p>By using cascading business priorities and activities, employee work objectives are aligned with the priorities of the Clerk of the Privy Council and those of the organization. A performance agreement is well aligned when its commitments reflect both sets of priorities.</p>
