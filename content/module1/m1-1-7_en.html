                <p>Performance improvement plans (formerly known as action plans) are used to document specific steps to support employees by helping them get on track. Performance improvement plans become an essential part of the employee's performance agreement. It is crucial that you and the employee document all the details of your discussions related to the performance improvement plan. Resources are available for both you and the employee. These include advisors from Labour Relations and Human Resources. The Informal Conflict Management System and the Employee Assistance Program can also be useful, especially if a conversation is likely to be stressful.</p>

                    <p>Employees require a performance improvement plan when managers identify unsatisfactory performance. During conversations on progress, employees may also request a performance improvement plan if they think it will help them overcome a challenge or obstacle.</p>
                    <p>Ongoing monitoring is essential so that you can document whether the employee is improving and adjust the performance improvement plan if required. Review panels are also responsible for reviewing, at least annually, progress made against individual performance improvement plans.</p>

                    <h2>When are performance improvement plans implemented?</h2>
                    <p>At any time, when you become aware that an employee is not on track to meet performance expectations, you need to discuss how a performance improvement plan can benefit both the employee and the organization.</p>
                    <p>However, a performance improvement plan is mandatory at yearâ€‘end, if:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The overall performance rating indicates that the employee has not met expectations; or</li>
                        <li>The employee has not met expectations for either work objectives or core competencies.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The performance improvement plan is incorporated into the employee's performance agreement for the following year, if required. The performance improvement plan does not expire with the end of the Performance Management Annual Cycle, but remains in effect until:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The employee's performance has improved to a satisfactory level; or</li>
                        <li>On the file's evidence, you conclude that there was no improvement and that other recourse actions are required.</li>
