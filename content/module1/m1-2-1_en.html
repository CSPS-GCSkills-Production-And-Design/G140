                    <p>Throughout the year, as a manager, you need to keep an eye on each of your employee’s performances, as well as documenting your observations.<br>During this phase, you need to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be aware of what to do once you start assessing employee performance;</li>

                                <p>With the performance agreement established, your employee should be clear about work objectives and the standard to which you expect the work to be completed.</p>
                                <p>Your role up to this point has been to ensure that your employee is clear as to what is expected of them through the performance agreement and has what they need to perform at an acceptable level. Have you provided the tools, training and support needed? Does your employee require an accommodation to complete tasks?</p>
                                <p>You will begin to assess your employee’s performance. You may want to begin documenting a file for your own records. In the next few slides, we will look at some ways to best assess and monitor performance, as well as how you communicate with your employee.</p>
