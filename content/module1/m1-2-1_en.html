	<p>Your role up to this point has been to ensure that your employee is clear as to what is expected of them through the performance agreement and has what they need to perform at an acceptable level. Have you provided the tools, training and support needed? Does your employee require an accommodation to complete his or her tasks?</p>

	<p>You will begin to assess your employee’s performance. You may want to begin documenting a file for your own records. In the next few slides, we will look at some ways to best assess and monitor performance, as well as how you communicate with your employee.</p>
