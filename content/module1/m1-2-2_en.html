                                <p>How should you assess your employee’s performance? How often should you communicate your thoughts about this?</p>
                                <p>Two‑way communication and feedback are part of regular dialogue with an employee. If performance is below the standard that you established in the performance agreement, your employee shouldn’t hear about it for the first time at the mid‑year review period. You should informally assess performance, progress or results on a regular basis and have informal conversations about them as needed.</p>
                                <p>Along with regular dialogue, employees should expect to be able to talk more formally about their performance with you. This will allow them to make any appropriate adjustments before the year-end or end of probation period assessment.</p>
                                <p>As a manager, you will monitor each employee’s progress towards the objectives you both agreed on as well as the competencies required for their position. In this way, your employees will be aware of their progress and results throughout the review period. You should encourage employees to initiate discussions with you about their progress at any time.</p>
