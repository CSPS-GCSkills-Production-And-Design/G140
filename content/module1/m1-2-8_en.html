Rather, provide a comment on what additional supports will be provided to help the employee improve (e.g.&nbsp;additional learning activities or an action plan).</p><p>The signature does not indicate agreement with the results; it only means a conversation has taken place. Employees who do not agree with the results may record their reasons in the space provided for comments.</p><p>Link to <a data-cke-saved-href="https://intranet.canada.ca/hr-rh/ptm-grt/pm-gr/pmc-dgr/dp-dr-eng.asp" href="https://intranet.canada.ca/hr-rh/ptm-grt/pm-gr/pmc-dgr/dp-dr-eng.asp" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Documenting performance">documenting performance</a></p></div>
