As a manager or supervisor, you must also refer to the appropriate Treasury Board Secretariat and departmental policies, collective agreements and guidelines. You may also consult with your department's human resources and labour relations divisions, if necessary.</p>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The Directive on Performance Management requires annual assessments for all employees at the end of each year or at the end of probation, with a rating that takes into account the employee's performance and how it was achieved.</p>
                <p>Using the principles and guidance provided earlier, it is important that you take the time to provide regular feedback to your employee, engage in dialogue, and ensure a formal year‑end assessment.</p>
                <p>If, at the end of the year, your employee's performance is at or above the required level, you can resume dialogue with the employee as part of a regular performance management regime. However, if your employee's performance is unsatisfactory, further measures are required.</p>
            </div>
                <div class="col-md-6 well naration"><p><strong>Key consideration:</strong> Capable and skilled employees may fail to deliver quality work for reasons like the unavailability of services or a lack of support tools or training. Performance assessments must not be negatively impacted by such situations, which are beyond the control of employees. Managers must make every effort to provide their employees with the support they need to do their work.</p></div>
