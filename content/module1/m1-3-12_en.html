                <p>While performance management can ultimately lead managers to take action such as helping the employee find alternative employment that better matches their skills, demoting them (involuntary demotion), or even terminating them, please remember that this is not the norm. With most of your employees, you will likely never have to go beyond providing some occasional corrective feedback.</p>

                <p>You may consider the following options if the employee's performance remains unsatisfactory:</p>
                <h2>Finding Alternative Employment</h2>
                <p>This option may be appropriate where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The employee has the qualifications and experience to perform as expected in another position at the same level that is better suited to them;</li>
                    <li>A position at the same level is available.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Involuntary Demotion</h2>
                <p>This option may be appropriate where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The employee has demonstrated ability that suggests they may be successful in meeting the performance expectations of a lower-level position;</li>
                    <li>A lower-level position exists.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Termination for Unsatisfactory Performance</h2>
                <p>This option may be appropriate where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The employee has had support in meeting performance expectations and there is no lower-level position in which the employee can reasonably be expected to succeed.</li>
                    <li>You believe that the employee cannot meet performance expectations and will not reasonably be able to meet them in short order.</li>
