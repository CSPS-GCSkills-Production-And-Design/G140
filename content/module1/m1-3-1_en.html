                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The Directive on Performance Management requires annual performance assessments for all employees at the end of each fiscal year or at the end of a probation period. To effectively assess and rate your employee’s performance, an end-of-year or end-of-probation conversation between you and your employee is essential. The results of this discussion will give you the information you need to determine whether the employee has succeeded or failed to meet their performance expectations, and to what extent. A rating that takes into account the results achieved (work objectives) and how they were achieved (core competencies) will be attributed.</p>

                <p>The ratings for work objectives and core competencies combined generate an overall performance rating, based on the following grid.</p>
                <p>The overall rating appears in the box where the work objectives rating on the vertical axis meets the core competencies rating on the horizontal axis. Rating descriptions and examples for work objectives and core competencies are provided on the Web site of the performance management program for employees as well as in the Public Service Performance Management Application (PSPM App).</p>
                <p>In the PSPM App, the overall rating is automatically generated once you have entered the rating for the employee’s work objectives and for the core competencies.</p>

                            <p>This figure on overall performance ratings consists of a five-level rating scale for work objectives on the&nbsp;<strong>y</strong>&nbsp;axis and a five-level rating scale for core competencies on the&nbsp;<strong>x</strong>&nbsp;axis. This results in a 25‑cell matrix, arranged in a square five cells high by five cells across.</p>
                            <p>The two rating scales both begin with the rating of “Did not meet” in the lower left-hand corner and progress along both axes, increasing to the rating of “Surpassed.” Each of the 25&nbsp;cells displays a predetermined value from “Did not meet” to “Surpassed.”</p>
                            <p>For the bottom row, the predetermined values for the five cells (left to right) are “Did not meet,” “Did not meet,” “Succeeded minus,” “Succeeded minus” and “Succeeded minus.”</p>
                            <p>For the second row from the bottom, the predetermined values for the five cells (left to right) are “Did not meet,” “Succeeded minus,” “Succeeded minus,” “Succeeded” and “Succeeded.”</p>
                            <p>For the third row from the bottom, the predetermined values for the five cells (left to right) are “Succeeded minus,” “Succeeded minus,” “Succeeded,” “Succeeded” and “Succeeded plus.”</p>
                            <p>For the fourth row from the bottom, the predetermined values for the five cells (left to right) are “Succeeded minus,” “Succeeded,” “Succeeded,” “Succeeded plus” and “Succeeded plus.”</p>
                            <p>For the top row, the predetermined values for the five cells (left to right) are “Succeeded minus,” “Succeeded,” “Succeeded plus,” “Succeeded plus” and “Surpassed.”</p>
