                <p>At any time during the performance management cycle, when you become aware that an employee is not on track to meet their performance expectations, you must first identify the factors that could cause the problem and then determine the appropriate actions</p>
                <p>Examples of likely factors include excessive workload; unclear roles and responsibilities; poorly defined performance objectives and expectations; insufficient training, experience or supervision; personal problems, and inappropriate behaviour.</p>
                <p>The factors behind the employee&rsquo;s unsatisfactory performance may or may not be within their control. A discussion with the employee will allow you to identify the factors at play and explore possible solutions to improve their performance. Each case of unsatisfactory performance is unique, so you must tailor your approach to the situation.</p>
                <p>Do not hesitate to contact a human resources specialist for advice as soon as you notice unsatisfactory performance in an employee.</p>
                <h2>When to Make a Performance Improvement Plan (Action Plan)</h2>
                <p>Performance improvement plans are mandatory, if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The overall performance rating indicates that the employee has not met expectations; or</li>
                    <li>The employee has not met expectations for either work objectives or core competencies.</li>
                </ul>

                            <p>When an employee’s performance is below the required level and informal coaching and feedback doesn’t seem to be working, a formal performance management meeting must take place to discuss how a performance improvement plan can help. The website on the performance management program for employees provides guidance and information on how to develop a performance improvement plan.</p>
