Remember that this is part of your role as a manager and supervisor. Some managers and supervisors may be tempted to shy away from conflict and difficult conversations, but having all your employees performing to a satisfactory standard as a minimum is simply part of being in the public service.</p><p>We hope the information and techniques that follow will be of use to you if you face performance issues. Remember that you're not alone! You can call for support from your own manager or supervisor, a human resources expert, a labour relations expert and others if you need to.</p></div>
