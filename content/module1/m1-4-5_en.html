                            <p>Some managers and supervisors may be hesitant to do the proper follow‑up on performance management issues such as providing regular feedback, scheduling regular performance meetings and documenting a file for fear of being accused of harassment. This should not be the case. Conducting proper and respectful performance management is part of a manager’s and supervisor’s obligations.</p>
