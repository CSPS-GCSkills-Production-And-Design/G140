            <p>Performance issues can sometimes tell you that there may be a need to accommodate, even when the employee has not asked for an accommodation. As a manager, you are legally obligated to accommodate your employee up to the point of undue hardship. It’s possible that not accommodating the employee could result in discrimination under one of the 13&nbsp;prohibited grounds of discrimination. However, bear in mind that there are limits to accommodation and each case should be examined on a case-by-case basis. The information on this and the following slides should help to clarify the limits.</p>
