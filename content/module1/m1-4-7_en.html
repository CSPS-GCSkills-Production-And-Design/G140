	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-4"><p>When you receive a request for accommodation or perceive a need, your first step is to determine whether the request falls under one or more of the 11&nbsp;grounds of discrimination that are prohibited under the&nbsp;<em>Canadian Human Rights Act</em>. When in doubt, consult your human resources, labour relations and/or legal services units. While the duty to accommodate is often applied to situations involving disabilities, it also applies to the other grounds, such as family status, religion and pregnancy.</p></div>

	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-5"><p>Eleven&nbsp;(11) grounds of discrimination are prohibited under the&nbsp;<em>Canadian Human Rights Act</em>, as follows:</p><ul><li>Race;</li><li>National or ethnic origin;</li><li>Colour;</li><li>Religion;</li><li>Age;</li><li>Sex (including discrimination because of pregnancy or childbirth);</li><li>Sexual orientation;</li><li>Marital status;</li><li>Family status;</li><li>Disability (a disability is a physical or mental condition that is permanent,&nbsp;ongoing, episodic or of some persistence, and is a substantial&nbsp;or significant limit on an individual's ability to carry out some of&nbsp;life's important functions or activities, such as employment. Disabilities&nbsp;include&nbsp;visible disabilities, such as the need for a wheelchair, and invisible disabilities, such as cognitive, behavioural or learning disabilities, and mental health issues); and</li><li>Conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.</li></ul><h2>Examples of duties to accommodate</h2><p>The employee is no longer able to perform a job or comply with current workplace policies or requirements as a result of changes in his or her situation. For example, the employee has developed a disability, has converted to a religion that imposes new obligations, or has experienced a change in family status.</p><p>An employee tells you, "I'm having trouble getting to work at my scheduled start time because of new family responsibilities." You will need to get more information from the employee about the particular situation in order to assess further.</p><p>An employee tells you that she would like a new office chair because her present one is uncomfortable. You should clarify with the employee whether the reason for the request arises from a medical requirement.</p></div>
