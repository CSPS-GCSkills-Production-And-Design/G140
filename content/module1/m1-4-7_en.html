            <p>When you receive a request for accommodation or perceive a need, your first step is to determine whether the request falls under one or more of the 13&nbsp;grounds of discrimination that are prohibited under the&nbsp;<em>Canadian Human Rights Act</em>. When in doubt, consult your human resources, labour relations and/or legal services units. While the duty to accommodate is often applied to situations involving disabilities, it also applies to the other grounds, such as family status, religion and pregnancy.</p>

                            <p>The employee is no longer able to perform a job or comply with current workplace policies or requirements as a result of
                                changes in their situation. For example, the employee has developed a disability, has converted to a religion that imposes
                                new obligations, or has experienced a change in family status.</p>
                            <p>An employee tells you, "I'm having trouble getting to work at my scheduled start time because of new family
                                responsibilities." You will need to get more information from the employee about the particular situation in order to assess
                                further.</p>
                            <p>An employee tells you that they would like a new office chair because their present one is uncomfortable. You should clarify
                                with the employee whether the reason for the request arises from a medical requirement.</p>
