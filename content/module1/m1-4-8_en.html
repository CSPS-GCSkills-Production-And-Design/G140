	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-4"><p>As a manager, you will have to look at each case individually. You want to accommodate your employee up to the point of undue hardship; but, you may have basic organizational needs attached to a certain position, known as a bona fide occupational requirement. The test for meeting a bona fide occupational requirement is very strict. The Supreme Court of Canada established a three-step process to establish a rational connection, good faith and reasonable necessity. Consult your human resources, labour relations and/or legal services units.</p></div>

	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-5"><p>Managers are required to provide accommodation up to the point of undue hardship.</p><h2>How do you determine undue hardship?</h2><p>There is no set formula for deciding what constitutes undue hardship. To help determine undue hardship, consider health, safety, cost, collective agreements, the interchangeability of the workforce and facilities, and the legitimate operational requirements of the workplace.</p><p>You should make serious, conscientious and genuine best efforts, document your efforts, and include input from the employee and the employee representative, where applicable, as well as from your organization's human resources/labour relations functional specialists. Remember, the process you follow is as important as the result.</p><h2>What is a bona fide occupational requirement?</h2><p>The law recognizes that a limitation on individual rights may be reasonable and justifiable in employment situations.</p><p>Example: Individuals employed as truck drivers must meet vision standards and have an appropriate driver's license. If an employer can show that there are specific requirements that every individual performing a specific job must meet because they are essential to the effective and safe performance of the job, then no duty to accommodate arises because this does not constitute discrimination.</p><p>Link to&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/wellness-inclusion-diversity-public-service/diversity-inclusion-public-service/working-government-canada-duty-accommodate-right-non-discrimination/duty-accommodate-general-process-managers.html" href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/wellness-inclusion-diversity-public-service/diversity-inclusion-public-service/working-government-canada-duty-accommodate-right-non-discrimination/duty-accommodate-general-process-managers.html" target="_blank" rel="external" title="Duty to Accommodate: A General Process for Managers">Duty to Accommodate: A General Process for Managers</a>.</p></div>
